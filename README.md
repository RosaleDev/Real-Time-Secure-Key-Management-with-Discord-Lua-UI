# Real-Time-Secure-Key-Management-with-Discord-Lua-UI
ve built a secure key management system using Firebase Realtime Database and a Discord bot. It allows me to add, remove, or extend keys in real-time. A Lua UI displays key data, while encryption and access control ensure security. The system is scalable and easy to use for managing access efficiently.
