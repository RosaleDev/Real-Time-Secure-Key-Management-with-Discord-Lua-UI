**Advanced Key System with Real-Time Database Integration & Discord Bot Management**

I’ve developed a secure and efficient key management system that integrates seamlessly with Firebase Realtime Database and a Discord bot, offering real-time updates and full control over keys. This system makes managing access keys simple, secure, and highly customizable.

**Key Features:**

Real-Time Database Sync: The system is built on Firebase Realtime Database, meaning that any changes to keys—whether adding, removing, or modifying them—are instantly reflected across all devices. This ensures that data stays consistent and up-to-date at all times.

Discord Bot Control: A custom Discord bot connects directly to the key system, allowing me to manage keys effortlessly. With a few simple commands, I can add new keys, delete old ones, or extend key durations. All changes are instantly updated in the Firebase database through the bot.

Lua-Based Key UI: The Lua UI provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for interacting with the system. It’s designed to display key information clearly, with all data synchronized directly to Firebase, ensuring everything is accurate and up-to-date.

Strong Security Measures: Security is a top priority, so the system uses encryption and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can modify key data. Every action is logged, so there’s a full audit trail for accountability and traceability.

Scalable & Flexible: Whether I’m handling a handful of keys or thousands, the system is built to scale effortlessly. It can handle large volumes of key management tasks without any performance issues, making it perfect for various applications.

This key management solution provides a reliable, secure, and user-friendly way to control access across my system in real time.
